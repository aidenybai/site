◕ ◡ ◕ っ Hi, I'm Aiden! I'm a {age} y/o from Washington State interested in **research** and **open source**.

Right now, I'm learning about building **JavaScript UI libraries**! I wanna tinker with impactful JavaScript tooling to make faster user experiences, more developer happiness, and elegance through functional composition. Currently exploring how JavaScript libraries can be augmented using compilers, WebAssembly, and web workers with <Link href="/work/million-js"><a>Million.js</a></Link>.

Last summer, I created projects with 42 other high school hackers on a train ([Hacker Zephyr](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BID8_pGuqA))

In junior year of high school, I won **2nd place** in Systems Software at the [International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF)](https://www.societyforscience.org/press-release/2021-regeneron-isef-grand-awards/#:~:text=SOFT031%20%E2%80%94%20Lucia%3A%20Creating,States%20of%20America) out of 1.8k+ students around the world with my <Link href="/work/lucia-js"><a>Lucia.js</a></Link> project.

I also made **[KBowl](https://kbowl.aidenybai.com) (virtual Knowledge Bowl events)**. I launched in September 2020, helping organize 30+ schools and 1k+ students in Washington State. It powered the entire Washington State High and Middle School leagues throughout the year.

I like blasting music with my windows down on the highway (88rising \<3), design, poetry, cycling, and binging boba popsicles. My favorite song is [Sunkissed by khai dreams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSkd4NC1kqY).
