◕ ◡ ◕ っ Hi, I'm Aiden! I'm a {age} y/o from Washington State interested in **research** and **open source**.

#### <mark>Present</mark>

I'm learning about building **JavaScript UI libraries**! I wanna tinker with impactful JavaScript tooling to enhance user + developer web experiences. Currently exploring how JavaScript UI libraries can be augmented with precompilation with <Link href="/work/million-js"><a>Million.js</a></Link>.

In the summer of 2022, I'm thrilled to be interning at [**▲ Vercel**](https://vercel.com/) to help work on projects in the Next.js ecosystem and learn more about bleeding _edge_ technology of web development.

In sophomore year of high school, I won the **2nd place** grand award in Systems Software at the [International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF)](https://www.societyforscience.org/press-release/2021-regeneron-isef-grand-awards/#:~:text=SOFT031%20%E2%80%94%20Lucia%3A%20Creating,States%20of%20America) out of **1.8k+ students** around the world with <Link href="/work/lucia-js"><a>Lucia.js</a></Link>.

I pioneered [KBowl](https://kbowl.aidenybai.com) (virtual [Knowledge Bowl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_Bowl) events) during the COVID-19 lockdown. I launched in September 2020, helping organize **30+ schools, 40+ teachers and 1k+ students** in Washington State. It powered the entire high and middle school leagues for Washington State throughout 2020 and 2021.

I like blasting music with my windows down on the highway (_88rising ( ´Д`)ﾉ_), design, poetry, cycling, and binging boba popsicles. My favorite song is [_sunkissed_ · khai dreams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSkd4NC1kqY).
