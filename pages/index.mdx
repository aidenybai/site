◕ ◡ ◕ っ Hi, I'm Aiden! I'm a {age} y/o from Washington State interested in **research** and **open source**.

Right now, I'm learning about building **JavaScript UI libraries**! I wanna tinker with impactful JavaScript tooling to make faster user + developer experiences. Currently exploring how JavaScript UI libraries can be augmented using compilers, WebAssembly, and web workers with <Link href="/work/million-js"><a>Million.js</a></Link>.

Last summer, I created projects with 42 other high school hackers on a train ([Hacker Zephyr](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BID8_pGuqA)) + worked at [Remake](https://remaketheweb.com) by leading efforts to refactor the internal API and drafted proposals on live collaboration features.

In sophomore year of high school, I won **2nd place** in Systems Software at the [International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF)](https://www.societyforscience.org/press-release/2021-regeneron-isef-grand-awards/#:~:text=SOFT031%20%E2%80%94%20Lucia%3A%20Creating,States%20of%20America) out of 1.8k+ students around the world with my <Link href="/work/lucia-js"><a>Lucia.js</a></Link> project.

I also made [KBowl (virtual Knowledge Bowl events)](https://kbowl.aidenybai.com). I launched in September 2020, helping organize **30+ schools, 40+ teachers and 1k+ students** in Washington State. It powered the entire high and middle school leagues for Washington State throughout the year.

I like blasting music with my windows down on the highway (_88rising ( ´Д`)ﾉ_), design, poetry, cycling, and binging boba popsicles. My favorite song is [_sunkissed_ · khai dreams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSkd4NC1kqY).
