# ⏱️ YourHours

Claim and certify your volunteer hours **on demand**.

## Our Vision

We serve the silent majority of potential volunteers who want to help the community but don't have the time to commit to a volunteer organization. We're a non-profit, volunteer-led organization that's committed to helping people like you claim volunteer hours anytime.

**Mission:** We want to bring back **what volunteering really means <sub>\[1\]</sub>**.

<small>
  \[1\]: **vol·un·teer**: _freely_ offer to do something, absent of obligation and compensation

## What is YourHours?

YourHours is fiscally sponsored by [The Hack Foundation](https://apps.irs.gov/app/eos/detailsPage?ein=812908499&name=Hack%20Foundation&city=West%20Hollywood&state=CA&countryAbbr=US&dba=&type=CHARITIES,%20DETERMINATIONLETTERS,%20COPYOFRETURNS&orgTags=CHARITIES&orgTags=DETERMINATIONLETTERS&orgTags=COPYOFRETURNS), a 501(c)(3) non-profit (EIN 81-2908499), meaning that by extension **YourHours inherits a non-profit status** and is backed by a non-profit foundation.

Additionally, **YourHours provides [Presidential Volunteer Service Award](https://presidentialserviceawards.gov/) opportunities** for students who volunteer under YourHours. These presigious awards are given to dedicated volunteers that spend hundreds of hours on helping others. We recommend checking you to check [eligibility requirements](https://presidentialserviceawards.gov/eligibility).

## Why?

Let's imagine a situation:

You're a high school student. You've taken a lot of subjects in school (Algebra, Art, Spanish, etc.) and you want to **use your skills to give back to the community** while getting **certified hour logs** for your volunteering efforts **on demand**.

You want to start tutoring but you also want to certify the hours you spend volunteering. You start looking around for possible avenues of hours certification, and you do! It's this volunteer program called:

> <GenericName />

You hop in a weird Zoom call with a bunch of random people. They onboard you and require you to fill out 10 different application forms. You're informed that you need to attend a mandatory meeting every week, and get a vague promise that you'll be paired up with students in need.

You think to yourself:

> It's probably worth all the unnecessary effort and obligation right? I just want to help people while getting hours...
>
> Wait... are they even a non-profit organization? Who knows \_(ツ)\_/

### The Problem

**This is the issue.** Volunteering **should not be driven by a system.** It's not supposed to be cyclical or paired based on the organization. Volunteering should be **done on-demand, NOT by the demands of the system**.

YourHours aims to solve this problem. Instead of taking the centralized, systematic approach of organizations, **YourHours prioritizes you willingness to volunteer**.

You can volunteer whenever you want, and YourHours will certify your volunteer hours on demand. It's **simple as sending a single email.**

## How?

YourHours allows you to **claim and certify your volunteer hours without joining a volunteer organization**. It works like this:

1. Reach out to us ([see contact details](#ix27m-interested))
2. Receive acceptance or rejection email with onboarding information from YourHours.
3. If accepted, you'll be able to start claiming your hours by sending an email to us with volunteering details.
4. YourHours will respond with a denial or fulfillment of a certification with a hash (_a special series of unique characters that represents your volunteering record_). These hashes can be [looked up here](#hash-lookup).

## I'm interested!

Shoot us an email with the subject `"Let's talk!"` to [YourHours@aidenybai.com](mailto:YourHours@aidenybai.com). Please answer this single question:

1. How can YourHours benefit you?

And we'll get something cookin'! Excited to talk to you soon.

_Note: By reaching out, you agree to uphold our [Code of Conduct](#code-of-conduct)._

---

## Code of Conduct

1. Be respectful and professional to others.
2. Do not endanger or compromise the well-being of others, whether intended or not.
3. Be ethical and responsible with your actions (e.g. [do not commit hours fraud](#security))

## Security

YourHours has the authority to certify your hours within the period you are volunteering for. You can only claim hours within the time period you're in YourHours, and you cannot "double dip", or certify your hours with multiple organizations to artifically inflate volunteering hours.

Behind the scenes we have undisclosed methods to check the legitimacy of your volunteering hours. Despite this, if you find that a volunteer is submitting fraudulent hours, please contact [YourHours@aidenybai.com](mailto:YourHours@aidenybai.com) immediately. All liability for abuse of the system rests with the volunteer and by joining YourHours, you agree to this.

_Note: YourHours ensures **permament records for all certification requests**. This is done through email, so you can lookup the status of certification requests through your email inbox. Additionally, fulfilled requests are encoded in a hash, which can be looked up anytime._

## Hash Lookup

Every volunteering record is certified with a hash that is emailed in response to a certification request. You can enter a hash to verify the details of your volunteering hours.
