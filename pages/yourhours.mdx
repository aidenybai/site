# ⏱️ YourHours

> Claim and certify your volunteer hours without joining a volunteer organization.

Let's flip the traditional model of volunteering organizations by redistributing the power to the volunteers. Together, we can **democratize 1-1 relationships of volunteers** with students in need through relevant fields of education.

[Skip the details →](#ix27m-interested)

## Why?

You're probably a high school student. You've probably taken some sort of subject in school (Algebra, Art, Spanish, etc.) and you want to **use your skills to give back to the community** while getting **certified hour logs** for your hard earned volunteer work.

Now, you probably have a cousin who's struggling in Algebra. You'd be willing to tutor them but you also want to certify the hours you spend volunteering. You start looking around for possible avenues of hours certification, and you do! It's this random program called:

> <GenericName />

Yep, great. You hop in a weird Zoom call with a bunch of people you've never met before. They onboard you and tell you to fill out 10 different Google Sheets, forms, introduction descriptions, etc. You're informed that you need to attend a mandatory meeting every week, and have a vague promise that you'll be paired up with students.

You think to yourself:

> It's probably worth it right? I need the volunteer hours certification because they're a nonprofit... even though I just want to tutor my cousin.

### The Problem

**This exactly is the issue.** Volunteering **should not be system.** It's not supposed to be cyclical or paired based on the organization. Volunteering should be **done on-demand, NOT by the demands on the system**.

This is why YourHours exists. Instead of taking the centralized, systemized approach of organizations, **YourHours prioritizes you**. Volunteering is done on demand, and YourHours exists to provide and certify volunteer hours.

## How?

YourHours is fiscally sponsored by [The Hack Foundation](https://apps.irs.gov/app/eos/detailsPage?ein=812908499&name=Hack%20Foundation&city=West%20Hollywood&state=CA&countryAbbr=US&dba=&type=CHARITIES,%20DETERMINATIONLETTERS,%20COPYOFRETURNS&orgTags=CHARITIES&orgTags=DETERMINATIONLETTERS&orgTags=COPYOFRETURNS), a 501(c)(3) non-profit (EIN 81-2908499), meaning that by extension **YourHours is a non-profit organization**. YourHours are backed by a non-profit organization, and you can reference this by providing the EIN number and name of the organization.

Additionally, **YourHours provides [Presidential Volunteer Service Award](https://presidentialserviceawards.gov/) opportunities** for students who volunteer for YourHours. These presigious awards are given to dedicated volunteers that spend hundreds of hours on helping others. We recommend checking [eligibility requirements](https://presidentialserviceawards.gov/eligibility).

### Process

YourHours allows you to **claim and certify your volunteer hours without joining a volunteer organization**. You can send a email with information about your volunteer hours (`"Certification request"`) and YourHours will respond with a denial or fulfillment of a certification with a hash (a special series of unique characters that represents your volunteering record).

YourHours has the authority to certify YourHours within the period you are volnteering for. You do not recieve hours for hours recieved before your YourHours application, and you cannot "double dip", or certify YourHours with multiple organizations to artifically inflate YourHours.

_Note: YourHours ensures **private, permament records for all certification requests**. This is done through email, so you can lookup the status of certification requests through your email inbox. Additionally, fulfilled requests are encoded in a hash, which can be looked up anytime._

### Hash Decoder

Every volunteering record is certified with a hash that is emailed in response to a certification request. You can enter a hash to verify the details of your volunteering hours.
