> Claim your tutoring volunteer hours without joining a volunteer organization.

Let's flip the traditional model of volunteering organizations by redistributing the power to the volunteers. Together, we can **democratize 1-1 relationships of volunteers** with students in need through relevant fields of study in STEM.

[Skip the details](#ix27m-interested)

## Why?

You're probably a high school student. You've probably taken some sort of STEM class (Algebra, Chemistry, Physics, etc.) and you want to **use your skills to give back to the community** while getting **certified hour logs** for your hard earned volunteer work.

Now, you probably have a cousin or family friend who's interested in STEM and you'd be willing to tutor them for a bit. You start looking around for possible avenues of hours certification, and you do! It's this cool program called:

> <GenericName />

Yep, great. You hop in a weird Zoom call with a bunch of people you've never met before. They onboard you and tell you to fill out 10 different Google Sheets, forms, introduction descriptions, etc. You're informed that you need to attend a mandatory meeting every week, and have a vague promise that you'll be paired up with students.

You think to yourself:

> It's probably worth it right? I need the volunteer hours certification because they're a nonprofit... even though I just want to tutor my cousin.

### The Problem

**This exactly is the issue.** Volunteerism through tutoring **is not a system.** It's not supposed to be cyclical or paired based on the organization, rather it's a **one-to-one relationship** between the volunteer and the student. Volunteering should be **done on-demand, NOT by the demands on the system**.

This is why STEMpulse exists. Instead of taking the centralized, systemized approach of organizations, **STEMpulse prioritizes the tutor**. Tutoring is done on demand and is the responsibility of the tutor, and STEMpulse exists to provide and certify volunteer hours.

## How?

STEMpulse allows you to **claim your tutoring volunteer hours without joining a volunteer organization**. You can send a email with information about your volunteer hours (`"Certification request"`) and STEMpulse will respond with a denial or fulfillment of a certification with a hash (a special series of unique characters that represents your tutoring record).

STEMpulse is fiscally sponsored by [The Hack Foundation](https://apps.irs.gov/app/eos/detailsPage?ein=812908499&name=Hack%20Foundation&city=West%20Hollywood&state=CA&countryAbbr=US&dba=&type=CHARITIES,%20DETERMINATIONLETTERS,%20COPYOFRETURNS&orgTags=CHARITIES&orgTags=DETERMINATIONLETTERS&orgTags=COPYOFRETURNS), a 501(c)(3) non-profit (EIN 81-2908499), meaning that by extension **STEMpulse is a non-profit organization**.

Additionally, **STEMpulse provides [Presidential Volunteer Service Award](https://presidentialserviceawards.gov/) opportunities** for students who volunteer for STEMpulse. These presigious awards are given to dedicated volunteers that spend hundreds of hours on helping others. We recommend checking [eligibility requirements](https://presidentialserviceawards.gov/eligibility).

STEMpulse has the authority to certify your hours within the period you are tutoring for. You do not recieve hours for hours recieved before your STEMpulse application, and you cannot "double dip", or certify your hours with multiple organizations to artifically inflate your hours.

_Note: STEMpulse ensures **private, permament records for all certification requests**. This is done through email, so you can lookup the status of certification requests through your email inbox. Additionally, fulfilled requests are encoded in a hash, which can be looked up anytime._

### Hash Decoder

Every volunteering record is certified with a hash that is emailed in response to a certification request. You can enter a hash to verify the details of your volunteering hours.

## I'm interested!

Shoot me an email with the subject `"Let's talk!"` to [stempulse@aidenybai.com](mailto:stempulse@aidenybai.com). Please answer these two questions:

1. Why do you want to help other students interested in STEM?
2. How can STEMpulse benefit you?

And we'll get something cookin'! Excited to talk to you soon.
