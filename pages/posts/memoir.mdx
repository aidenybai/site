# An Ode to CoolMathGames.com

&emsp;&emsp;Wham! The door of my room slams open as my father burst in with smoke steaming out of his nose, face tormented than a dragon, exclaiming in Chinese, “混蛋！别玩游戏了！” (“Bastard! Stop playing [video] games!”).

&emsp;&emsp;Since I was 7 years old, my Asian parents, in an attempt to provide a “better future” for me, forced me to excel in becoming a model Asian child. In addition to school, I had to attend 4 hours of after-school tutoring every day. In the evening, I was compelled by my parents to attend a variety of random activities, whether it be piano, ping-pong, guitar, or even art class. You might think, “at least you have the weekends to take a break right?” Wrong. Weekends, by tradition, were for Chinese school and test preparation, the two things I dreaded the most as a child.

&emsp;&emsp;If there’s one thing I’ve learned from my childhood indoctrination, it’s that if you force someone to do something, they will grow to hate it. While I did survive the tribulations imposed upon me, I definitely didn’t find them enjoyable at all. In fact, I absolutely abhorred the daily grind of mindlessly scribbling homework and staring at whiteboards, often filled with complex formulae. Of course, I couldn’t just let my mind melt. For example, when the teacher in my after school tutoring program, who we’ll dub “Mr. Kim,” spotted a student slacking off or with their eyes glazed over like a Krispy Kreme donut, he would softly tiptoe over and whack his war-battered yardstick on the table, producing a reverberating “Boom!” two inches from the student’s face. Simultaneously, he would shout, “Wake up ‘stoo-pee’!”, As his musty, coffee stained breath drifted and overwhelmed the victim’s nose. Needless to say, I never slacked off when I was in Mr. Kim’s class. Due to this, I was continuously overwhelmed with homework, anxiety, and stress. Unlike my peers, I rarely had the opportunity or freedom to relax and play video games, as the second I completed some unit of work, I was bombarded with the tenfold of the original amount. My parents enlisted a rigorous workload and unspoken strict regulations, and one of the primary policies was “NO VIDEO GAMES.” This sort of indoctrination was successful. I scored perfect marks in elementary school, oftentimes ranking at the top of my class, thanks to the training provided to me by my parents, even though I absolutely despised it and just wanted to play video games. My wish was granted when I entered middle school.

&emsp;&emsp;Our grade was the first year to receive the new pilot 1:1 Chromebook initiative when I entered middle school. I still remember being handed a fresh, plastic-smelling Chromebook by the librarian, wearing a beaming smile on my face. Rushing home after school, I shot the charger into the Chromebook port, happily awaiting the bootup screen with the sleek colored Chromebook logo. For me, receiving a Chromebook meant infinite access to a “resource” my strict Asian parents never provided me: video games. School became my safe haven, it was like an escape for me from the pressures I felt every day. It didn’t matter what class I was in, whether it be science, English or mathematics, I was in the back of the classroom, fingers tapping the keyboard, grinding a wide variety of low-quality Flash games on CoolMathGames.com. Through CoolMathGames.com, I was able to express myself in ways I hadn’t before. Whether it was mastering game mechanics or conversing with other players I felt I finally had a home and a purpose in my monotonous daily routine.

&emsp;&emsp;It all came crashing down one day, as the school district caught on to our shenanigans, made obvious by the rising issue of students not paying attention to the teacher during class time. To prevent this, they instituted the trump card: web blocking filters. I was absolutely devastated. What was once a happy place where I could do whatever I wanted, like paint on a canvas, was ruined as if the canvas was struck by lightning and burned to ashes. Even though I sulked in disappointment and sorrow for a couple days, I searched for ways to satisfy my addiction. At first, I settled on alternative “unblocked” Flash game sites, but as more students moved over to these sites, the district’s network administrators swifty caught on and blocked the site faster than I could recall my multiplication tables. One day, while I was browsing online trying to find another unblocked site, I came across some cryptic HTML (the markup language that websites are composed with) that seemed to be able to embed other websites on your own websites. As my brain slowly processed how this code worked, a lightbulb popped over my head. I realized that I could embed CoolMathGames.com on my own website using HTML. Thus, my coding journey began.

&emsp;&emsp;Nowadays, I’m no longer trying to bypass web filters or playing video games. As I’ve progressed through the years, I’ve outgrown playing Flash games. However, the same spirit of freedom, my start on coding, and my successes today can be directly attributed to the days where I played those low-quality Flash games on CoolMathGames.com. CoolMathGames.com isn’t just a website with games. For me, it’s a representation of the catalyst that allowed me to find something I love. Just like forcing a seed to germinate by forcibly drowning it in water will result in it becoming moldy and dying of disease, if one is forced to do something, their love of that subject will diminish and die. Allowing for precipitation and natural forces to germinate the seeds is often the healthiest choice, as only then can it sprout and thrive into a healthy plant.
