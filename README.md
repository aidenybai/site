## About

This is where I host all my thoughts, poetry, and information about me. The website is built using [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app/) using the `nextra-theme-docs` theme.

The awesome thing about this site is that everything related to the content is in a `md` or `mdx` file. This means you don't need to write a bunch of HTML just to get content to show up.
